          structure:

    HTML Collection
    Node Collection

    They can be converted into an array, but they are not considered arrays.
    Many people are unable to differentiate between an HTML collection and an array
          -->
                


    <!--
    1. HTMLCollection
            Think of an HTMLCollection like a live list of things on your webpage.
            If you add or remove items (like paragraphs or buttons), the list
            updates automatically. But it doesn’t work like a normal array
            — you can’t use cool tricks like map() or filter() directly on it.
    Example:
     "Imagine you’re watching a basket of apples.
      If someone adds or removes apples, you’ll immediately see the changes."

2. NodeList
A NodeList is a list of nodes (not just elements).
 Nodes can be things like text, elements, or comments.
Some NodeLists are live (they update), and some are static 
(they don’t). This part makes it confusing!
Like HTMLCollection, it also doesn’t act like a true array.
Example:
"Imagine taking a picture of the basket of apples. 
A picture won’t change even if someone adds or removes apples."

3. Array
An Array is the "super cool" version! You can do a lot of 
fancy things with it, like sorting, filtering, or finding items.
But HTMLCollection and NodeList aren’t true arrays, so you can’t
 use array methods on them directly.
Example:
"If you want to turn your basket or picture into a notebook where you 
can write, erase, or rearrange apples, you need to convert it into an array."

Why Do People Get Confused?

HTMLCollection and NodeList look like arrays but don’t act the same way.
You need to convert them into arrays if you want to use array tricks.-->
