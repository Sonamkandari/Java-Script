// java script is a synchronous language
/* In a synchronous language or execution model:
 Tasks are executed sequentially: Each operation must complete before the next one begins. */


/*In an asynchronous language or execution model:
Tasks do not block execution: Long-running tasks (e.g., network requests, file reading)
are executed in the background.The program can continue executing other tasks while waiting
for the previous one to complete.Once the task finishes, a callback, promise, or event is
used to handle the result.*/

//java script is a single threated language which refers it is a slow language as compare to the multithreaded languages

// execution context or global execution context

//Blocking code =>Blocking code is refers to a code which block the flow of a program --** read file Synchronous

//Non Blocking code =>Non Blocking code is refers to a code which does not block the flow of a program --** read file Asynchronous

// we can not access file system in browser

//therefore we used node js for accessing file system


//use of blocking and non blocking Queue denpends on the use case of the queue

//java script engine
//**Web Api
// environment (Node)


//**Taske Queue promise Queue ** Higher priority Queue

// call stack

// some New APIs is added in java script

//Fetch API, =>** higher priority 
//Await API
